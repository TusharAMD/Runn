## Approach:
To start things off, let me first explain what Wordle is. Wordle is a simple game where you have six chances at guessing a five-letter word.

After each prediction, the game will give you hints.

A green tile means that you predicted the correct placement of a letter.

A yellow tile means that the letter is in the word, but your prediction had the wrong position.

And lastly, a grey tile means the letter is not in the word. Every day the gameâ€™s word is reset, giving everyone a chance at guessing the correct word.
