## Space Ace
Space Ace is a LaserDisc video game produced by Bluth Group, Cinematronics and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems). 
It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the Dragon's Lair game, followed by a limited release in December 1983 and then a wide release in Spring 1984.

### Objective of Game
In Space Ace you play the heroic Ace who must stop the evil Commander Borf from taking over the Earth! 
Borf plans to reduce all of humankind to infants and take over the planet. 
Only two people have the courage and strength to stop Borf and save Earth: the beautiful Kimberly and the heroic Ace.

### Working of Game
At the start of the game, the player could select one of three skill levels: "Cadet", "Captain" or "Space Ace" for easy, medium and hard respectively; only by choosing the toughest skill level could the player see all the sequences in the game (only around half the scenes are played on the easiest setting). 
A number of the scenes had "multiple choice" moments when the player could select how to act, sometimes by deciding which way to turn in a passageway, or by choosing whether or not to react to the on-screen "ENERGIZE" message and transform back into his Ace form. 
Most scenes also have separate, horizontally flipped versions.
Dexter usually progresses through scenes by avoiding obstacles and enemies, but Ace goes on the offensive, attacking enemies rather than running away; although Dexter does occasionally have to use his pistol on enemies when it is necessary to advance.
