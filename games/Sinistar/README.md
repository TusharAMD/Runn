## Sinistar
Sinistar is a multidirectional shooter arcade game developed and manufactured by Williams Electronics.The game was released in 1983.

### Objective of Game
The main objective of Sinistar is to break asteroids and collect the crystals that pop out, while preventing enemy worker drones from collecting them. 
Whenever a drone picks up a crystal, they'll take it to the site where they're building the Sinistar spaceship.

### Working of Game
The player pilots a lone spacecraft, mining drifting planetoids and catching the crystals which are released. 
Shooting a planetoid too rapidly destroys it without releasing any crystals. 
Each collected crystal turns into a "Sinibomb", which is needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face.

Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, but is constructed by enemy worker ships. 
Enemy worker ships collect crystals which they use to construct the Sinistar. 
Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship, shoot planetoids to mine crystals, and guard the Sinistar while it is being built. 
It takes 20 crystals to create the 20 pieces of a completely built Sinistar.

Once the Sinistar is constructed, a digitized voice makes threatening pronouncements while chasing the player's ship: "Beware, I live!", "I hunger, coward!", "I am Sinistar!", "Run! Run! Run!", "Beware, coward!", "I hunger!", "Run, coward!", and a loud roar. 
The Sinistar has no weapons, but it destroys the player's ship on contact. 
A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy Sinistar. 
Each Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by Workers, Warriors, and planetoids.
