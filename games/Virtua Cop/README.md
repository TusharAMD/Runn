### Working of Game
Players take of the role of one of the two police officers from a first person perspective. 
Players must avoid shooting hostages who will run across the screen trying to avoid being caught in the fire fight whilst shooting all the gun wielding antagonists.

A colored reticle will appear on the screen over opponents changing from green to yellow to orange to red indicating how much time the player has until they are shot at by the enemy.
They have six bullets in their chamber and must reload their shots when they run out, either by shooting off screen in the arcade version or pressing the designated button twice quickly in the Saturn version.

As well as the standard six shooter revolver, players can get other weaponry pick ups by shooting certain power up weapons including an automatic gun, a shotgun and a magnum.

After each stage, the players will face off against a boss character with their own health bar and attack patterns.
Upon defeating all three bosses; Kong, King and Boss, Joe Fang will turn up himself to fight the players in the final fight.
